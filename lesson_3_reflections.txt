When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	1. When collaborating with one or more people. 
	2. When you want to use more than one computer (office and home, etc)
	3. When you want comments from other people on your project.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Changes made by others to the remote may affect the changes that you are working on.
