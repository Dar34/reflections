When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	1. When collaborating with one or more people. 
	2. When you want to use more than one computer (office and home, etc)
	3. When you want comments from other people on your project.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Changes made by others to the remote may affect the changes that you are working on. 
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Branches - Different Heads that contain changes that are not present in other branches.
	Clones - Exact copy of a Repository
	Fork - Clone made on GitHub by the GitHub site for you.
