When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	1. When collaborating with one or more people. 
	2. When you want to use more than one computer (office and home, etc)
	3. When you want comments from other people on your project.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Changes made by others to the remote may affect the changes that you are working on. 
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Branches - Different Heads that contain changes that are not present in other branches.
	Clones - Exact copy of a Repository
	Fork - Clone made on GitHub by the GitHub site for you.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	1. You can tell how far ahead it you are, in commits
	2. If you pull/push updates it is easier to find the conflicts if you know where to start
	
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	I would probably use Google docs, especially for something like recipes. Getting up and running on GDocs would 
	be much easier. However, tracking and finding changes over a long period of time would be easier with GH.
