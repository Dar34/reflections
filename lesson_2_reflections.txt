1.  What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	A hidden directory (.git) is created. This directory will house the meta data
	that tracks changes in your files.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

		Staging area holds files that are going into the repository as a single commit. The repository holds all commits,
		and the working directory holds all the files that are available to add to the commit.
